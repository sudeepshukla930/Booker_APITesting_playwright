## ü§ñ Overview
This repository contains a Playwright API automation framework in TypeScript for testing the RESTful Booker API. The framework includes test cases that cover various API operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting bookings.
***

## üõ† Requirements Fulfilled 

1. **Create a Booking**: Test data for the POST request is built using a separate POJO (Plain Old JavaScript Object) to generate random booking data.

2. **Assert Create Booking Response**: The response of the Create Booking request is validated against the data posted in the request body.

3. **Save Booking ID**: The Booking ID from the Create Booking response is stored in a variable for further test usage.

4. **Get Booking Details**: Retrieve booking details using the Booking ID and compare them with the initial data used for booking creation.

5. **Token Generation Method**: A method is implemented to generate tokens for use in PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests.

6. **Update Booking Details**: Update all booking details using the Booking ID and AUTH token generated. Separate booking data is created for this operation.

7. **Assert Update Booking Response**: Validate the status code and response of the update booking operation.

8. **Update Partial Details with PATCH**: Update only firstname and totalprice using a PATCH request.

9. **Assert PATCH Response**: Validate the status code and response returned from the PATCH request with the updated data supplied.

10. **Delete Booking**: Delete a booking and assert the status code of the deletion operation.

11. **Confirm Deletion**: Verify that attempting to retrieve a deleted booking returns a 404 status code, confirming successful deletion.

### üìú Files Details & Role

Certainly! Here are the details of each file in the Playwright API Automation Framework:

1. **`postPojo/bookingData.ts`**:
   - **Purpose**: This file contains a Plain Old JavaScript Object (POJO) for generating random booking data.
   - **Functionality**: It provides a structure for creating random booking data that can be used in POST requests to create bookings.

2. **`requests/`**:
   - **Purpose**: This directory includes functions for making various API requests.
   - **Files**:
     - `postRequest.ts`: Function for making POST requests to create bookings.
     - `getRequest.ts`: Function for making GET requests to retrieve booking details.
     - `putRequest.ts`: Function for making PUT requests to update booking details.
     - `patchRequest.ts`: Function for making PATCH requests to partially update booking details.
     - `deleteRequest.ts`: Function for making DELETE requests to delete bookings.

3. **`validations/apiValidation.ts`**:
   - **Purpose**: This file contains validation methods for validating API responses.
   - **Functionality**: It includes functions to validate responses from API requests based on the requirements specified.

4. **`generalMethods/generateToken.ts`**:
   - **Purpose**: This file provides a method for generating authentication tokens.
   - **Functionality**: It offers a reusable method to generate tokens that can be used in PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests.



Each file plays a specific role in the framework, contributing to the overall functionality of the Playwright API automation tests. Together, they form a cohesive system for testing the RESTful Booker API with Playwright in TypeScript.

## üìå Keypoints & Learning:

**Key Takeaways from the Booking API Testing Framework:**

1. **Modular Design**: Breaking down the testing logic into separate modules for data generation, requests, validations, and token management enhances code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

2. **Sequential Test Execution**: Running tests in a specific order ensures proper flow and dependency management, mimicking real-world scenarios and maintaining test reliability.

3. **Environment Variables Usage**: Leveraging environment variables for storing and sharing data like booking IDs and authentication tokens improves test flexibility, efficiency, and adaptability to different testing environments.

4. **Response Validation**: Thoroughly validating API responses against expected data ensures the correctness of operations, helps in detecting errors or inconsistencies, and boosts overall test reliability.
